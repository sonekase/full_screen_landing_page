    <p>Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high and the dreams that you dream of, once in a lullaby. Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
    and the dreams that you dream of, dreams really do come true</p>
    <p>Someday I'll wish upon a star, wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Where trouble melts like lemon drops,high above the chimney top,
    that's where you'll find me.</p>
    <p>Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly and the dream that you dare to why, oh why can't I?</p>
